# Phishin Tests Don't Fix the PROBLEM

This is a list (not exaustive) of the domain names used for mock phishing tests. It is of mine, and a few other people in the space that these types of tests are not something that fixes anything, they may be useful to find who to educate, but that is not really an issue to test this way. 

Get better security controls in place. Dont vilify your employees.
